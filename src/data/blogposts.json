The fact I am writing blog posts in JSON is insane. Honestly, for what I'm trying to do here, React does not seem useful. Astro would likely be a better bet."

As a test, this worked well, as shown by the above screencap. I was even able to use anonymous authentication. However, a concern remains regarding malicious writes -- while I santized all form inputs, I am still wary about spam writes that would eat bandwidth. In researching ways to mitigate this, it essentially required stronger authentication options, which I, frankly, do not have the time to implement. Therefore, I have set my security rules to essentially deny all writes. \n In all honesty, if I were to go truly live with this (rather than as a simple github page for proof of concept), I'd use Netlify to host it since Netlify provides a form handler and spam filter."
